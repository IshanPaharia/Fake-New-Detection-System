# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection System

Fake news has become one of the most significant challenges in the age of digital information. This project presents a machine learning-based Fake News Detection System that can accurately classify news articles as **genuine** or **fake**, helping users and organizations safeguard against misinformation.

---

## Overview

The system leverages **machine learning algorithms** to analyze textual data from news articles. By identifying patterns in writing styles, vocabulary, and context, the model learns to distinguish between factual and misleading content.

This project involves:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of news datasets  
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization  
- Training ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, etc.)  
- Evaluating performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy  
- Building a basic web interface for testing input articles

---

## Features

- Binary classification: Fake vs Real  
- Multiple ML models compared for performance  
- Interactive and easy-to-use architecture  
- Scalable for larger datasets and real-world applications

---

## Machine Learning Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

---

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset which includes thousands of news articles from reliable and fake news sources.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics provide a well-rounded view of model performance and generalizability.
